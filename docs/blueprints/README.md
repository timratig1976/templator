# 🚀 Modular Project Blueprints
## Enterprise-Grade Application Foundation

*A collection of focused, modular blueprints based on proven patterns from the Templator project. Each blueprint focuses on a specific domain and can be used independently or combined for comprehensive application development.*

## 📋 **Blueprint Collection**

### **Core Architecture**
- **[📁 Project Structure](./01-project-structure.md)** - Complete monorepo organization with DDD
- **[🏗️ Domain-Driven Design](./02-domain-driven-design.md)** - DDD patterns and implementation
- **[🗄️ Database Architecture](./03-database-architecture.md)** - Core DB platform (Postgres/Prisma, performance, migrations). Feature schemas live in thematic blueprints below.

### **Quality & Testing**
- **[🧪 Testing Strategy](./04-testing-strategy.md)** - Comprehensive testing pyramid with mocks
- **[🔒 Security Implementation](./05-security-implementation.md)** - OWASP-compliant security patterns

### **Application & Performance**
- **[🚀 Application Foundation](./06-application-foundation.md)** - Error handling, logging, API design, configuration
- **[⚡ Performance & Real-time](./07-performance-realtime.md)** - Caching, WebSockets, background jobs, monitoring
- **[🔧 DevOps & Deployment](./08-devops-deployment.md)** - CI/CD, infrastructure, development setup
- **[🔗 Microservices & Integration](./12-microservices-and-integration.md)** - Service boundaries, contracts, messaging, gateway

### **AI & Intelligence**
- **[🤖 AI Pipeline Architecture](./09-ai-pipeline-architecture.md)** - OpenAI integration, prompt engineering, orchestration — includes Database Integration notes
- **[🧠 RAG Systems](./13-rag-systems.md)** - Retrieval strategies, chunking, vector stores, caching, evaluation — includes Database Integration (pgvector/external vector DB)
- **[🧩 AI Maintenance & Quality](./11-ai-maintenance-and-quality.md)** - Prompt versioning, evaluation, A/B testing, rollback — includes Database Integration (prompt models)

## 🎯 **How to Use These Blueprints**

### **For New Projects**
1. Start with **Project Structure** for overall organization
2. Implement **Domain-Driven Design** for business logic
3. Set up **Database Architecture** for core data platform
4. Add **Testing Strategy** for quality assurance
5. Implement **Security** patterns from day one
6. Add specialized features (AI, Real-time) as needed. Consult each blueprint's **Database Integration** section for schema guidance.

### **For Existing Projects**
- Use individual blueprints to enhance specific areas
- Each blueprint is self-contained with complete examples
- Patterns can be adopted incrementally

### **Blueprint Features**
- ✅ **Complete Code Examples** - Ready-to-use implementations
- ✅ **Best Practices** - Proven patterns from production systems
- ✅ **Incremental Adoption** - Use what you need, when you need it
- ✅ **Technology Agnostic** - Adaptable to different tech stacks
- ✅ **Production Ready** - Battle-tested in real applications
